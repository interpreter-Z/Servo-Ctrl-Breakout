Servo Control Breakout Board (EasyEDA)
- A simple breakout board that interfaces a microcontroller (ATTiny85, acting as slave) with 3-pin servos (eg. SG09)
- Enables a master controller to control servos via the slave microcontrollers (I2C)
- Breakout board houses an Hall-effect current sensor that allows slave controllers to measure supply currents to the servo

Requires assembly and testing
